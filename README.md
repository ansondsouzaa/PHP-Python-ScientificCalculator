# PHP & Python Scientific Calculator

This is a web-based scientific calculator that allows users to perform various mathematical calculations using PHP and Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, square, square root and factorial.

## Features

- Register, Login with Password, Login with email OTP, Logout
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Trigonometric functions: Sin, Cos, Tan.
- Square root and Square.
- Factorial calculation.
- Log
- Option to switch between Degrees and Radians for trigonometric functions.
- Auto-closing parentheses to simplify expressions.
- Input validation to prevent invalid expressions.
- Real-time toggle between AC (All Clear) and CE (Clear Entry) buttons.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7 or higher
- Python 3
- Web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) with PHP support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local web server directory

2. Make sure the web server has PHP and Python installed.

3. Make sure the web server has PHP and Python installed.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the calculator's URL (e.g., http://localhost/scientific-calculator).

2. Enter a mathematical expression using the provided buttons.

3. Click the "=" button to calculate the result.

4. To switch between Degrees and Radians for trigonometric functions, click the "RAD" or "DEG" buttons.

5. The "AC" button is displayed when the page is submitted (result is calculated), and the "CE" button is displayed when modifying the expression.

## Examples

- Simple addition: `5 + 7 = 12`
- Trigonometric function in Degrees: `sin(30) = 0.5` (when in DEG mode)
- Square root: `√(16) = 4`
- Factorial: `5! = 120`
- Square: `2² = 4`

## Known Issues

- The calculator currently doesn't handle complex expressions or nested parentheses.
